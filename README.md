**The neutral freight reference layer for AI agents.**

FreightUtils is the neutral freight reference layer for AI agents — authoritative dangerous-goods, customs, location and freight-calculation data an agent can call and cite, from primary sources (ADR 2025 / UNECE, HS 2022 / WCO, IATA-regulated airline prefixes). Neutral by design: no freight to sell and no carrier to push, so an agent can trust it as ground truth regardless of who carries the load.

This [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server gives AI agents access to 24 freight calculation and reference tools, covering road, air, and sea freight. Built by a UK ADR-certified freight transport planner.

## Installation

### Claude Desktop / Claude Code (stdio)

Add to your MCP config (`claude_desktop_config.json` or `.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "freightutils": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["freightutils-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Remote HTTP / SSE

If your MCP client supports remote servers, use the canonical URL:

```
https://www.freightutils.com/api/mcp
```

> The older URL `https://www.freightutils.com/api/mcp/mcp` still works for backwards compatibility with existing clients.

No API key required to get started — anonymous calls work out of the box (see Rate Limits below).

### Authenticating with a Pro key

Anonymous usage caps at 25 requests/day per IP. If you have a free or Pro API key, set `FREIGHTUTILS_API_KEY` in the environment that runs the MCP server. The package reads it from `process.env` and attaches `Authorization: Bearer <key>` to every outbound `/api/*` call — same key the remote `https://www.freightutils.com/api/mcp` transport already honors.

stdio config example with the env var wired through:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "freightutils": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["freightutils-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "FREIGHTUTILS_API_KEY": "fu_pk_xxx"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Get a key at [freightutils.com/api-docs](https://www.freightutils.com/api-docs) (free, 100/day) or [freightutils.com/pricing](https://www.freightutils.com/pricing) (Pro, 50,000/month). Backwards compatible — unset env var preserves the existing anonymous behaviour.

## Verify your setup

After adding FreightUtils to your MCP client config, **fully quit and relaunch the client** (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cline). MCP servers are only loaded at client startup; editing the config in a running session does nothing until restart.

Then run the install diagnostic from a terminal:

```sh
npx freightutils-mcp ping
```

You should see three ticks and `All checks passed`:

```
FreightUtils MCP Diagnostic

```

If any check shows ✗, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) below. Exit code is 0 on all-pass and 1 on any failure, so the command works in CI / health-check scripts too.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Tools not appearing in the MCP client after editing the config | Client wasn't fully restarted | Quit and relaunch (Cmd+Q on macOS / right-click → Quit on Windows tray). Closing the window is not enough. |
| `npx freightutils-mcp ping` check 1 fails with a network error | DNS, proxy, or the website is unreachable from your network | Check the status page at https://www.freightutils.com/status. If you're behind a corporate proxy, set `HTTPS_PROXY`. Override the host for `ping` with `FREIGHTUTILS_API_URL=<base-url>`. |
| `npx freightutils-mcp ping` check 2 fails | Broken local install (npx cache or stale Node version) | Re-install: `rm -rf ~/.npm/_npx && npm install -g freightutils-mcp` and rerun. Requires Node 18 or newer. |
| Tool calls return HTTP 429 / `"rate_limited"` | Anonymous IP cap of 25 requests/day exceeded | If you have a FreightUtils Pro API key, set `FREIGHTUTILS_API_KEY` in your environment before invoking the MCP. The package passes it through automatically on every outbound call. See https://www.freightutils.com/pricing if you need a key. |
| `"Server failed to start"` / spawn error in client logs | `npx` not on PATH, or Node older than 18 | Install Node 18+. On macOS, an absolute path in the config (`"command": "/opt/homebrew/bin/npx"`) avoids PATH issues for GUI-launched clients. |
| Specific tool returns `isError: true` | Bad input shape, or an unknown lookup key (UN number / HS code / AWB prefix not in the dataset) | The tool's error body names the offending field. Verify against the schema at https://www.freightutils.com/api-docs or call the corresponding [playground](https://www.freightutils.com/playground) endpoint to confirm the input shape. |

The full diagnostic flow lives at the [/api-docs#mcp-setup](https://www.freightutils.com/api-docs#mcp-setup) section on the website. The live backend status is callable from inside any MCP client at [GET /api/mcp/health](https://www.freightutils.com/api/mcp/health) — useful when you don't have shell access during a conversation.

## Changelog

Full release notes also on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/SoapyRED/freightutils-mcp/releases).

### 2.4.0 — 2026-06-16
- **`consignment_calculator` → canonical consignment v1.** New transport `mode` (sea | air | road) and a canonical `lines[]` shape (each line: `quantity`, `dims {l,w,h,unit}` mm/cm/m/in, `weight {value,unit}` kg/g/t/lb, optional `description`/`hs_code`/`un_number`/`stackable`), plus an `options` object (`air_volumetric_divisor` default 6000, `container_number`, `awb_number`). The legacy flat `items[]` array (cm/kg) still works unchanged. Output gains per-line + grand totals, a `schema_version`, and advisory-only flags (implausible density, mode/option mismatch, dangerous-goods presence by UN number vs the ADR 2025 reference, ISO 6346 / IATA AWB check-digit) plus a best-effort disclaimer. Canonical schema: <https://www.freightutils.com/schema/consignment.v1.json>. **No tool-count change (19).**

### 2.1.1 — 2026-05-09
- **Fix:** `serverInfo.version` was stuck at `1.0.8` even after 1.1.0 / 2.0.0 / 2.1.0 published. The wire-level identity has been silently lying about the package version since the 1.0.7 fix. Now reads from `package.json` at runtime via `createRequire`, so the wire version always matches the npm-published release.
- **Fix:** `server.json` description undercounted tools (`"18 freight tools …"` → `"19 freight tools …, get_subscribe_link"`).
- **Tightened Zod input constraints** across `airline_lookup`, `adr_lookup`, `adr_exemption_calculator`, `adr_lq_eq_check`, `unlocode_lookup`, and `uk_duty_calculator` (regex / length / min-max on UN numbers, IATA / ICAO / AWB prefixes, ISO country codes, UN/LOCODE format). Field-level constraints take effect at the wire; `.strict()` on top-level schemas becomes wire-effective once the `server.registerTool()` migration ships in 2.2.0.

### 2.1.0 — 2026-05-01
- **New tool: `get_subscribe_link`.** Returns the FreightUtils `/pricing` URL plus tier / monthly limit / monthly price metadata. Tool description tells agents NOT to attempt checkout themselves — they hand the URL to the user. **Tool count: 18 → 19.**
- Pairs with the website-side fix wiring `/api/mcp/*` through the existing API rate-limit middleware so Pro keys are attributed against the 50,000/month bucket on MCP traffic.

### 2.0.0 — 2026-04-25 (BREAKING — input-side casing)
- **Tool input schemas migrated `camelCase` → `snake_case`** to match the response convention shipped in 1.1.0. 13 input keys renamed across `uk_duty_calculator`, `consignment_calculator`, and `shipment_summary` (e.g. `commodityCode` → `commodity_code`, `originCountry` → `origin_country`, `items[].grossWeight` → `items[].gross_weight`). Agents calling these tools with prior camelCase keys now get a Zod validation error instead of a 200. **Re-prompt or update tool-call code.**
- All other tools (`cbm_calculator`, `chargeable_weight_calculator`, `ldm_calculator`, `pallet_fitting_calculator`, `unit_converter`, ADR family, `airline_lookup`, `container_lookup`, `hs_code_lookup`, `incoterms_lookup`, `unlocode_lookup`, `uld_lookup`, `vehicle_lookup`) already used snake_case (or single-word) input keys and are unchanged.

### 1.1.0 — 2026-04-25 (BREAKING — response-side casing)
- **API responses migrated `camelCase` → `snake_case` site-wide** across `/api/unlocode`, `/api/uld`, `/api/containers`, `/api/vehicles`, `/api/consignment`, `/api/duty`. All MCP tools in this package are passthroughs, so AI agents see snake_case keys (e.g. `commodity_code`, `location_code`, `internal_length_cm`) instead of the prior camelCase forms. **Re-prompt or update parsing logic.**
- No code changes to MCP tool implementations — every tool was already a passthrough wrapper around `apiGet` / `apiPost`. Input schemas continue to declare camelCase here; 2.0.0 deliberately closes that asymmetry.
- README badges: added monthly + total npm downloads alongside the existing version + license + Glama score badges.

### 1.0.8 — 2026-04-23 (hotfix)
- **Critical fix:** revert `list_prompts` / `list_resources` stub handlers introduced in 1.0.7. The raw SDK asserts the corresponding capability must be declared before `setRequestHandler` is called — 1.0.7 threw `Server does not support prompts` at startup, crashing the MCP server on every run. 1.0.8 removes the stubs and restores boot.
- Server identity bumped: `version: '1.0.7'` → `'1.0.8'`.
- No other changes. 18 tools, annotations, `shipment_summary` descriptions, and `smithery.yaml` from 1.0.7 are preserved.

### 1.0.7 — 2026-04-22
- Add `smithery.yaml` with empty configSchema (Smithery Quality Score: config UX +25).
- Add read-only `annotations` to all 18 tools (`readOnlyHint: true`, `destructiveHint: false`, `idempotentHint: true`, `openWorldHint: false`) with human-readable `title` (+7).
- Add missing parameter `.describe(...)` text to `shipment_summary` (+1).
- Add stub `list_prompts` / `list_resources` handlers so probes return `{ prompts: [] }` / `{ resources: [] }` instead of `-32601 Method not found` (+5).
- Fix server identity: `name: 'FreightUtils'` → `'freightutils-mcp'`, `version: '1.0.0'` → `'1.0.7'`.
- No breaking changes. Same 18 tools, same names, same behaviour.

### 1.0.6 — 2026-04-22
- Security: bump `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` to `1.26.0` to patch **CVE-2026-25536** (cross-client data leak via shared transport/server instance reuse). See [GHSA-345p-7cg4-v4c7](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-345p-7cg4-v4c7).
- No user-facing API changes. Same 18 tools.
